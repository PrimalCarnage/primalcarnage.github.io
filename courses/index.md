This wiki is a work in progress. If you have any further questions, please post in the Extinction Editor channel of the official Discord server.

These pages will give you a general understanding of how to use the Extinction Editor including creating maps, cinematics, and skins. It is recommended that you read each course in order, especially if you have never used Unreal Engine 3 / Unreal Development Kit.

The map-making courses are listed according to the normal progression of map creation, moving from blocking out areas using brushes, to adding static meshes, lighting and effects. Reading through these first will ensure you have a good grasp on the fundamentals of level design before tackling topics covered in the advanced courses, such as interactive sequences and Matinee cutscenes.

Before making a custom map that you intend to upload to the Workshop, please ensure you have set it up correctly as outlined here

There are also a few recorded video streams that give some basic overviews on certain topics. The written documentation provides more detailed information, with step by step processes for how to do things.
